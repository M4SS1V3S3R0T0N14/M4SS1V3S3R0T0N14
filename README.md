# Hi, I'm Guillaume 👋

I'm a Typescript front-end developer from France 🥖.

Passionate about computer programming and macro typography, I design practical solutions for all types of clients, and intuitive interfaces focused on the user and understanding. I’m currently working at [Soyhuce](https://soyhuce.fr/) 🚀

I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects 🤝.
